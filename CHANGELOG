Change Log
==========

v0.3.1
------
- Updated the example program, which now works again after the API change
  in v0.3.0.
- Small fixups and additions to the README.md file on GitHub.

v0.3.0
------
- Changed the function signature of `pifacedigital_wait_for_input()`.
  There was a bug with the old function in that it would return 0 on
  both a possible valid interrupt state and a timeout. It was impossible
  to determine which caused the blocking function to return. To remedy
  this the function now returns a status code and the interrupted input
  state is stored at the data pointer provided. This will break existing
  code using this library and programs using this function will need to
  be updated. It is trivial to update the function call:

      uint8_t data = pifacedigital_wait_for_input(10, 0);

  turns to:

      uint8_t data;
      int status = pifacedigital_wait_for_input(&data, 10, 0);

v0.2.0
------
- Now with interrupts!

v0.1.0
------
- Initial release.
